                    <h3>Plot Overview</h3>
                    <p>In a world where hunters with special abilities battle deadly monsters to protect humanity, Sung Jinwoo is known as the "World's Weakest Hunter." After nearly dying in a dungeon, he awakens to a mysterious System that grants him unique leveling abilities, allowing him to grow stronger with each battle. As Jinwoo's power increases, he uncovers a global conspiracy and the true origin of his abilities, all while gathering an army of shadow soldiers from his fallen enemies.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Main Themes</h3>
                    <p>Solo Leveling explores themes of personal growth, power dynamics, sacrifice, and what it means to be truly strong. The series contrasts Jinwoo's humble beginnings with his eventual rise to power, examining how power changes relationships and perspectives. It also delves into family bonds, loyalty, and the moral implications of using others as tools.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Impact on the Industry</h3>
                    <p>Since its debut in 2018, Solo Leveling has revolutionized the manhwa industry and gained massive international popularity. Its unique art style, fast-paced action, and video game-like progression system established a new subgenre often referred to as "system" or "game-like reality" stories. The series' success paved the way for many similar titles and helped bring Korean manhwa to a global audience, eventually leading to its anime adaptation by A-1 Pictures in 2024.</p>

                    <h3>The System</h3>
                    <p>Unique to Sung Jinwoo, "The System" is a mysterious power that allows him to level up similarly to a video game character. Unlike other hunters whose abilities are fixed after awakening, Jinwoo can continuously grow stronger through completing quests, defeating enemies, and distributing stat points.</p>
                    
                    <p>Key components of The System include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Daily Quests:</strong> Tasks that must be completed within 24 hours</li>
                        <li><strong>Weekly Quests:</strong> More challenging tasks with higher rewards</li>
                        <li><strong>Main Quests:</strong> Story-driven missions that advance Jinwoo's overall progress</li>
                        <li><strong>Stat Points:</strong> Earned through leveling up, these can be distributed among Strength, Agility, Intelligence, and Sense</li>
                        <li><strong>Inventory:</strong> A dimensional space where Jinwoo can store items</li>
                        <li><strong>Store:</strong> A shop where Jinwoo can purchase items using points earned from quests</li>
                    </ul>

                            <p>Shadow Extraction is Jinwoo's signature ability as the Shadow Monarch.
